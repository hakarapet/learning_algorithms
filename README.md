# Learning Algorithms

## What a hell is this?
This is repo to recall my rusty brain about Algorithms. Also if somebody else will find this repo interesting and useful I will probably be very happy. I will go through some known algorithms and explain how do they work, why are they needed and, of course, how to write them (mostly in Python).

## Why the hell do I need this?
I need this so I could recall what I knew many years ago and maybe if I can use this in my current projects. I consider this is workout for my brain.

You, my friend, need this for the _same reason why you need to know the names of other countries or the names about famous writers and/or composers._

It is quite possible that in your everyday usage you will not use these algorithms, or you won't write them from scratch. But in cases when you are going to have an coding interview, or if you are going to code something low level or simply you want to become simply a better software developer, this is one of the _bricks_ that you need to (must to) have to build your professionalism.

## So what do we have here?
- [Big O notation](./algorithms/big_o_notation/big_o_notation.md)
- [Bubble Sort](./algorithms/bubble_sort/bubble_sort.md)
- [Quick Sort](./algorithms/quick_sort/quick_sort.md)
- [Binary Search](./algorithms/binary_search/binary_search.md)
- [Merge Sort](./algorithms/merge_sort/merge_sort.md)
